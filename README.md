# BrainStation-x-Shutterstock-Hackathon

### About
Using Shutterstock's default API and Tensorflow's Universal Sentence Encoder to create a Recommender System

### Concept
We used natural language processing to encoding meanings of sound descriptions and audio description such that we were able to compare these encoded meanings, and find similarities to match images and sound

### How it works
the recommender system searches for the top ten most similar audios by sentiment, and presents it to the consumer. So for example, if the image is dramatic, you will receive dramatic audios.
